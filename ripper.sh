#!/bin/bash

# This script will create a tool for Kali Linux that allows you to test a target IP or website URL for remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities. It will prompt you for the path to the RCE code to run, as well as the target IP or URL. ProxyChains will be configured to utilize Tor for anonymity. Additionally, it will utilize the preinstalled Kali Linux WordPress vulnerability scanner tool, wpscan.

# Install ProxyChains and Tor (if not already installed)
apt-get update
apt-get install -y proxychains tor

# Configure ProxyChains for Tor
sed -i 's/^dynamic_chain/dynamic_chain\nproxy_dns/g' /etc/proxychains.conf
echo "socks4 127.0.0.1 9050" >> /etc/proxychains.conf

# Prompt for the path to RCE code
echo "Enter the path to the RCE code:"
read rce_path

# Prompt for the target IP or URL
echo "Enter the target IP or URL:"
read target

# Execute RCE code using ProxyChains and Tor
proxychains $rce_path $target

# Use preinstalled Kali Linux WordPress vulnerability scanner tool - wpscan
wpscan --url $target --enumerate vp
